[Musicly's Website](https://m7kra.github.io/Musicly)

## Features

- Elegance: In musicly, there is nothing to distract you from your loved music. Just a couple nice looking buttons.

- Queue management: delete and reorder tracks in the queue.

- Covers: It is annoying when you can't see your covers. Therefore, covers are first-class citizens in Musicly.

- Edit album and track metadata: Changes are saved to files if they are in `mp3` format.

- Mini-player mode: Minimize Musicly to a small window and keep working.

- Dark theme & Custom CSS: Are you an obscure hacker, typing 0s and 1s in a monochrome display? We've got something for you!

- Inactivity mode: Musicly detects when you are inactive and displays the album's cover and track info.
