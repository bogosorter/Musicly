# Developer documentation

## A couple remarks

I'm not a seasoned programmer. In fact, my adventure in programming started about two years ago, in a somewhat unstable way. A couple courses, YouTube videos, etc. Therefore, my code isn't great. You should expect to find, some errors, and a lot of bad practices. I have, though, made some effort to write clean and understandable code, forcing myself to write a lot of comments (to many?) and to make a structured project (actually the first complete one).

This explains how this project came to be. Given that I'm inexperienced, I would appreciate any kind of feedback: any pull requests, issues, comments or just a thumbs-up!

I hope you get as exited with this project as I did.

*Final note: My English isn't great.*
