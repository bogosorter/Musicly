## What is Musicly?

Musicly is a simple and elegant open source music player.

## Features

- Simplicity: In musicly, there is nothing to distract you from your loved music. Just a couple nice looking buttons.

- Elegancy: Musicly has a nice looking interface, where you can enjoy your music without distractions.

- Covers: One of the most anoying things in some music players is not being able to see your album's covers. Therefore, Musicly makes sure you won't miss them.

- Dark mode: Are you an obscure hacker, typing 0s and 1s in a green and black screen? If so, we've got a dark theme for you!

- Custom CSS: Styling geek? You can use your own CSS in the app.

- Search: In one single query, filter by artist, genre, track and album title.

- Inactivity mode: If no movement is detected, Musicly will display the album cover in fullscreen (see images bellow).

- Cross-platform: Availiable for Linux, Windows and soon MacOS.
